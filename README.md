# Icy Tower Clone (not really)

The idea was to build the Icy Tower like game in a simplified version.

Some features are still missing, some are still buggy, but it's playable.

It's my first project in Unity Engine since I've finished related course on Udemy.

I used assets from https://www.kenney.nl/assets.
